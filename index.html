        <h1 id="First_Point_Header">1 Abstract</h1>
        <p>
          The use of virtual reality (VR) in the training curriculum for medical practitioners (MPs) is an unexplored area of research as of 2023. My investigation delves into the stakeholder question: “Is VR a good sector for funding in training MPs in the healthcare industry”, asked by the National Health Service (NHS). I used research and data analysis to further support the idea that it should be implemented. The introduction of VR could improve MP training in many ways, from surgery practice to remote working over the COVID-19 lockdown and has been scientifically proven to improve test scores. I will start with my hypothesis, stating my thoughts and presumptions. After which, I will find datasets and analyse them, producing visuals that I can infer results from. With these results, I will use them to determine the accuracy and reliability of my hypothesis. The report will end with my evaluation, stating all my findings, and answering the stakeholder question.

      <section class = "Main_paragraph"> <!-- Introduction -->
        <h1 id="Second_Point_Header">2 Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          A study of the number of doctors globally was conducted in 2017, stating that: “In comparison to other nations, England has a very low proportion of doctors relative to the population. The average number of doctors per 1,000 people in OECD EU nations is 3.7, but England has just 2.9”. <a href="#[7]">[7]</a> Throughout the world, there is always a need for healthcare and trained MPs, especially with the recent events of COVID-19 and the Russo-Ukrainian war as of 2022, where MPs are either at home or lacking in numbers. Training of MPs is quite limited, by current practices. Using physical resources and professional tools means that MPs dont always have access, something that VR could fix. Currently, there is very little VR used in the healthcare industry since it is a relatively recent technology, and not commonly thought of as healthcare technology. However, VR has had astounding results in different industries, ranging from the military to aerospace, so why not the healthcare industry? “Application and development of VR simulators should be professionally promoted just as flight simulators in aviation”. <a href = #[5]>[5]</a> 
        <p>
      </section>

      <section class = "Main_paragraph"><!-- Literacy review -->
        <h1 id="Third_Point_Header">3 Literature review</h1>
        <p>
          Training is arguably the most likely use of VR in the healthcare industry. Utilising digital tools alongside physical tools will provide a much more streamlined training curriculum for MPs. “Medical Augmented Intelligence creates AR and VR educational tools for doctors and medical students.” <a href = #[3]>[3]</a> MPs typically practice physically, using limited resources, but with modern-day VR they would be able to practice in the most up-to-date simulations (alongside physical practice) while still feeling the same simulation they would when practicing physically: “using realistic vibration patterns, the haptic technology gives doctors the feeling of holding actual tools.” <a href = #[3]>[3]</a>
        <p>
        <h2 id="Third_Sub_Point_1">3.1 Finances</h2>
        <p>
          Furthermore, from a financial standpoint, VR is a cheaper alternative in the long run as it is a reusable resource. Current education for medical practitioners requires the use of in-person practice, often on deceased human and animal parts, and always using expensive, professional-grade medical instruments. This could be replaced by the introduction of VR tools and simulations instead of physical objects. “For economic reasons regional training centers seem to be an effective way to realize a broad implementation of VR simulation in surgical training.” <a href = #[5]>[5]</a>. Additionally, this citation mentions the idea of training centres for VR. This would be a great additional benefit as in-training MPs would be able to work from home or in training environments outside of hospitals. Allowing them to work whenever they need to. This has been experimented with by the NHS, by giving nurses special “goggles” and having them communicate with patients at home. “High tech goggles will be worn by community nurses on home visits to free up time with patients, as part of a cutting-edge NHS pilot.” <a href = #[6]>[6]</a> 
        </p>
        <h2 id="Third_Sub_Point_2">3.2 Test Results</h2>
        <p>
          Determining if the VR training is effective is the most crucial part of the NHS question. A study conducted by Seymour, N.E. et al., compared the results of two groups, one trained by VR and the others not. They discovered that: “Mean errors were six times less likely to occur in the VR-trained group (1.19 vs. 7.38 errors per case;P < .008, Mann-Whitney test).” <a href = #[8]>[8]</a> Furthermore, another study from the ‘Harvard Business Review’ stated that “participants in the VR group received significantly higher ratings in all categories compared to the traditionally trained group, with an overall improvement of 230%” <a href = #[2]>[2]</a> Even for a more specific surgery such as hip arthroscopy: “VR training could improve patient outcomes by 83% as demonstrated during a hip arthroscopy in a randomised controlled trial.” <a href = #[9]>[9]</a> 
        </p>
        <h2 id="Third_Sub_Point_3">3.3 Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Considering the test results from the studies mentioned above, I believe that the implementation of VR should immediately be considered, if not implemented already. Even from a financial standpoint, although VR would be a very expensive investment in the short term, due to its reusability, it would make up for it in the long run, especially with the potential future enhancements of VR such as haptic feedback hands and body tracking.  
        </p>
        <h2 id="Third_Sub_Point_4">3.4 Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>
          VR will have a significantly positive impact on the current curriculum, changing the way training is currently undergone. With the right implementation, this technology could completely redesign MP training, making it more efficient, resourceful, and successful.  
        </p>

      <section class = "Main_paragraph"><!-- Methodology -->
        <h1 id="Fourth_Point_Header">4 Methodology</h1>
        <p>
          The next step in answering the stakeholder question was to make use of datasets. For most of my datasets, I collected them from the website Statista.com. Statista is a trusted website that releases published datasets around most topics. For my other dataset, I retrieved it from Kaggle.com. To process these datasets, I downloaded them as CSV (Comma Separated Value) files and imported them into Visual Studio Code (VScode). Then, using Python’s Pandas software, I programmed an algorithm to sort through the datasets by columns of data and produce graphs with the columns as the axes.  
        <p>
        <pre>def market2022(): # Function which stores the algorithm
          market2022 = pd.read_csv("Data\VR-worldwide-market-share-2022.csv") # reading the data in the csv file
          graph = sns.barplot(data = market2022, x = "Industry", y = "Market Share (%)") # creating a barplot and storing it in a variable called "graph"
          plt.title("Forecast distribution of the augmented and mixed reality market worldwide in 2022") # plotting the title
          for container in graph.containers: # for each bar in the bar graph
              graph.bar_label(container) # adds the value to the top of each bar
          plt.show() # displays graph</pre>

        <h2 id="Fourth_Sub_Point_1">4.1 Density of Doctors</h2>
        <figure>
          <img class = "graph" src="Graphs\Num_Doctors_2017.png">
          <figcaption>Figure 1: The number of doctors per 1000 people for each country (2017)<a href = #[1]>[1]</a></figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          To start with, I first researched the number of doctors per 1000 people in each country. 
        </p>
        <h2 id="Fourth_Sub_Point_2">4.2 Market Share 2022</h2>
        <img class = "graph" src="Graphs\Market2022.png">
        <figcaption>Figure 2: Statista Research Department. 2016. Projected Breakdown Of Global Augmented and Mixed Reality Market 2022 <a href = #[10]>[10]</a></figcaption>
        <p>
          The second dataset was the market share percentage of VR per industry in 2022. This gave me useful insight into how much VR was used recently in the healthcare industry. 
        </p>
        <h2 id="Fourth_Sub_Point_3">4.3 Market Share 2020 and 2025</h2>
        <img class = "graph" src="Graphs\Market2020.png">
        <figcaption>Figure 3: Statista Research Department. 2016. Forecast size of the augmented and virtual reality (VR/AR) market worldwide in 2020 and 2025, by segment (in billion U.S. dollars) <a href = #[12]>[12]</a></figcaption>
        <p>
          For the third dataset, I used a similar set to the first, but instead used values in terms of billions of USD and showed 2020 against a 2025 forecast. 
        </p>
        <h2 id="Fourth_Sub_Point_4">4.4 Hospital VR Usage 2018</h2>
        <img class = "graph" src="Graphs\Hospital2018.png">

        <p>
          The fourth dataset I used was like the dataset used in Figure 1 but delved further in detail into the VR already implemented in the healthcare industry. It shows the sum of VR already used in healthcare per region of the world in terms of billions of USD. 
        </p>
        <h2 id="Fourth_Sub_Point_5">4.5 Public VR Usage</h2>
        <img class = "graph" src="Graphs\PublicUsage.png">

        <p>
          The final dataset I used showed the public usage of VR for each major category, such as video games, films and entertainment, and education. I chose this dataset because it gave me insight into how much VR is used for educational purposes in terms of percentage. 
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class = "Main_paragraph"><!-- Results -->
        <h1 id="Fifth_Point_Header">5 Results</h1>
        <p>
          After creating visuals and analysing the data, we can see that the healthcare industry is expected to drastically increase its VR usage by 2025. Figure 3 shows that the VR healthcare market share will increase from 1.2 billion USD to 5.1 billion USD and Figure 4 forecasts around a 1000% increase for VR used in healthcare per region, ten times larger than the 2018 values. However, the market share value is still half the size of the video games market share. This makes sense as VR is always advertised and shown as a form of gaming rather than it being promoted as an educational system. This can be seen by the public usage in Figure 5. Big companies such as Meta and HTC are often advertising their VR consoles, such as the Meta Quest, and the HTC Vive.  
        <p>
        <p>
          My hypothesis was partially correct in stating that "VR would be an excellent investment for MP training and should be implemented as soon as possible.” While the main point of my hypothesis was correct, it was incorrect in the sense that I presumed VR was not being implemented as much as it was yet, but according to the datasets, by 2025 most regions of the world will be investing up to 4 billion USD into its implementation. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe that the datasets agreed with the literature review. The literature review showed that the results of training MPs with VR resulted in better test scores, which in turn explains the drastic increase in the forecast predictions for the VR healthcare market share as seen in Figure 4.   
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class = "Main_paragraph"><!-- Conclusion -->
        <h1 id="Sixth_Point_Header">6 Conclusion</h1>
        <p>
          After considering the data from my research, alongside the datasets, I can securely say that investing in VR for training MPs is a plausible and beneficial idea. From the data analysed above, increasing MP test scores and the rate of MP certification would provide a great improvement on the NHS, especially in the current war, or if a pandemic were to occur again.  
        <p>
      </section>

      <section class = "Main_paragraph"><!-- Recommendations -->
        <h1 id="Seventh_Point_Header">7 Recommendations</h1>
        <p>
          From this point on, I would recommend implementing VR training rooms and funding VR headsets and simulations for medical schools. MPs in training should have as much possible access to these headsets as possible, and they should be worked into the current curriculum. These simulations should help provide a base practicality for surgery, which they can perfect with physical training. In return, we should expect to see an increase in the training rate of MPs and their test scores within the next few years.
